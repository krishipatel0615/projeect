							<h4><a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/hoodies-pullovers-6rive">Hoodies and Sweatshirts</a></h4>
							<p> Nike's athletic wear covers all aspects of modern day sports. Let's start off with the hoodies and sweatshirts. Nike's hoodies and sweatshirts are mad specifically for the outdoors; whether it's raining or snowing, the material is built for it. They are also made to be as light as possible, allowing for the most unrestrained movement allowed while wearing the hoodie.</p>

								<h4><a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/mens-shorts-38fphznik1">Shorts</a> and <a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/mens-joggers-sweatpants-aepf0znik1">Joggers</a> </h4>
								<p> The shorts and joggers made by Nike are the most premium quality you will find in the country. They are made up 75% recycled polyster fabric, making them not only lightweight but also good for the environment. With the lightness of the material also comes the flexibility. Not only will you get great range of movement with the shorts, you will also be able to do the same in the joggers, which are made for athletic tasks that are performed in cold environments. </p>

								<h4><a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/mens-jackets-vests-50r7yznik1">Jackets</a>, <a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/training-gym-gear-58jtoz6bvfk">Training Exclusives</a>, and <a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/mens-accessories-equipment-awwpwznik1">Accessories</a></h4>
								<p> Jackets made at Nike are made exclusively for difficult weather and are tested to ensure that they can withstand what is thrown at them. Some training exclusives we provide are sturdy training cones, ladders, poles, and essential equipment for each sport, all which are made to the highest standard. Other accessories include fitted and regulars hats, water bottles, and backpacks.</p>
